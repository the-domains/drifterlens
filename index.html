</picture><h1>The Eye that Never Loses Suction</h1><h3>by Michael J Dentico</h3><p>It cleans by itself, so you don’t have to.</p><p>Meet the Dyson 360 Eye, the first robotic vacuum offering from the British firm noted for its classy commercials and space-age industrial design. The initial release in Japan last October was the culmination of just over sixteen years of work; the product
    was met with palpable excitement.</p><p>Work on the project began in 1999, just eight years after the company’s founding. James Dyson, the eponymous visionary, had already led his team to design a working, albeit underpowered prototype of the 360 Eye knows as the DC06 in 2001; he said regarding
    the matter at the time, “We’ve been developing a robot for years, and will produce a robot. And when we do, it will work. Properly.”</p><p>The concept isn’t new; iRobot’s Roomba has been a household name for years. The biggest apparent differentiator is price. When the 360 Eye launched in the UK last month for £799.00 ($999 MSRP), jaws dropped. The question is, does Dyson’s new product meet
    this valuation with features to match?</p><p>With its dome-shaped, live-vision 360° camera, Dyson's new machine captures a panoramic image of the room being cleaned; when coupled with the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) software chip, landmark-based navigation is achieved. The 360 Eye
    locks onto landmarks in the room to triangulate its position, ensuring a strategic cleaning pattern is devised and the unit knows which parts of the room it has already covered. Scheduling cleaning routines takes place via smartphone app.</p><p>It is also the only robotic vacuum with full tank tracks, which allows it to surmount household obstacles under 15mm in height. Similar to Roomba, the 360 Eye has drop detect sensors on its underside which prevent your thousand-dollar investment from
    taking a tumble down the stairs.</p><p>When it comes to its signature suction, the unit is equipped with the high-speed digital motor V2 which spins at a staggering 78,000 rpm, paired with Dyson’s trademarked Radial Root Cyclone, which the firm claims to be its most compact cyclone technology
    yet. Advanced air filtration ensures that the air expelled by the unit is cleaner than what went in.</p><p>A full-size brush bar includes both coarse nylon bristles for ground-in dirt and soft anti-static carbon fiber filaments to remove fine dust from hard floor surfaces.</p><p>To understand how grueling Dyson’s testing procedures are for a new product such as the 360 Eye, you need only look at the numbers. A team of 30 spent 100,000 hours in production. Prototypes underwent 297 validation tests, buttons on the device were pressed
    16,500 times, and the testing units traversed a total of 671 miles.</p><p>The company also put its money where its mouth is, investing £5 million into robotics research and development.</p><p>Public response seems to match the care Dyson has put into this project. Megan Wollerton at CNET cites the powerful suction and good cleaning action; Jason Roberts at Vacuums Guide chose to focus on the advanced movement algorithms the device uses for
    thorough cleaning. Overall, the Internet has spoken positively toward Dyson’s debut robotic offering. As the firm ramps up its North American marketing strategy for release by the end of the summer, only time will tell if the initial excitement progresses
    into continued satisfaction among users.</p><p>More information here:</p><p><a href="http://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/robot/dyson-360-eye.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener

</picture><p>Are we in the dog days of a broken system? A system with an elusive reward for empty labor, where your toil and time spent only reward you materialistically?</p><p>One can only hope.</p><p>For decades, the striving American has had to ritualistically abandon youthful idealism and dreams to the forces of the market. Without a well-timed stroke of luck, one's only option is to labor in a conformist system that dictates how you spend a great
    portion of your time.</p><p>This routine can rob us of our younger aspirations; the larger danger is that we unconsciously succumb to this routine, surrendering to a static pattern of life, unbroken by a mere 28.6% portion of each week considered "free time," where we can ruminate
    on the current state of affairs and try to muster the energy to perform more worthwhile pursuits. This, only to return to the same pattern come Monday.</p><p>What baffles me is that the outgoing active generation, the Boomers, largely made this surrender without incident, accepting it as "just what you do." How many talents went unnurtured, neglected to wither away on the sidelines of a blind and indifferent
    society?</p><p>Of course, there are exceptions. You can live on the fringe, where survival is closer to the forefront of your concerns in the name of passionate and fulfilling work. The obvious tradeoff is, to live well in this regard means to succeed into the same
    broken system you were rebelling against to begin with. What begins as a noble pursuit suddenly becomes the property of the market. The artist becomes the puppet at the hands of the moneyed marionette operator.</p><p>In short, this means surrendering your artistic or creative talents to the accountants and power brokers; create what will SELL, create what studies and focus groups have shown will be SUCCESSFUL. Forget artistic uniqueness or relevant message; homogeneous
    vanilla is a safer bet. With that said we can find relevance in today's media and art without a doubt, yet the compromises the artist has to make to exhibit a mere semblance of their original intent are palpable.</p><p>This is the true danger of the market; we find ourselves talking with intense and valid concerns about unfettered speculation and an unaccountable Wall Street, yet the real concern lies in the fact that a faceless economic entity determines what is produced,
    rather than natural human ingenuity and perception within the confines of that economy. This reality, unchecked, is turning us into a reactive and robotic populace. The burgeoning technology of today only augments this effect.</p><p>When we direct this schema towards the United States, it is at odds with the nature of our country. We prize the individual, yet we live in a time in which conformity dictates the will of the whole, groupthink taking center stage. A common literary debate
    involves questioning who was correct, Orwell with <em>1984</em> or Huxley with <em>Brave New World</em>? Whose dystopia has come to fruition in modern times?</p><p>Both have. Simultaneously.</p><p>So subtly, however, that it takes some peeling of the proverbial onion to appreciate the many-layered truth.</p><p>Large-scale dragnet surveillance revealed, perpetual warfare, bulging and unseemly defense budgets coming into question, whistleblowers like Edward Snowden opening our eyes to the grotesque wizard(s) behind the curtain. We are standing where Orwell would
    have given a cursory nod to this state of affairs.</p><p>Huxley on the other hand would be astonished by all of the modern distractions that have formed a warm, thick, pleasantly scented wool over our collective eyes. Heroin addictions in our suburbs, endless multimedia entertainment, fast-moving and unnecessary
    fashion and style trends, rampant consumerism, waste, easier travel, hedonism and hyper-sexualization, technology as a drug. Huxley would be astonished, yet his work would be validated before him if he were here today.</p><p>More recent works of literature, such as M.T. Anderson's 2002 satirical novel <em>Feed</em> serve as an extrapolation of existing trends; it is a piece written during the Information Revolution, portraying a fictional future America rife with constant
    connection, much like our existing smartphones and Internet. Yet in <em>Feed</em>, Anderson's characters are intimately merged with technology from birth; each newborn (conceived artificially by default due to ubiquitous sterility) is implanted with
    a neural microchip that irreversibly ties it to the marketplace and the collective consciousness.</p><p>Telepathic communication, whirlwind fads and hour by hour hairstyle changes, a deteriorating environment, an oblivious populace who are falling apart mentally and physically. This satire is a chilling yet plausible evolution of our current system if it
    persists, unabated by revolution or a collective awakening to the flaws of our ways.</p><p>Today's indifference should frighten you; how many conversations involving politics have you witnessed stopped in their tracks by someone who doesn't care? How many commercials have you seen advocating continued drilling for oil and natural gas, paid
    for by the same groups and lobbies that perpetuate the destruction of our environment?</p><p>The abstraction of profit and its uneven distribution has only caused our people and our planet immense strain. We view progress only in terms of continued monetary growth; what does this growth pursue? More growth. For the last half-century we have channeled
    initial postwar prosperity into nothing but additional economic expansion, not to the benefit of our own people or the domestic conditions of technology and innovation; mostly just to line the pockets (handsomely) of a handful of the ultra-wealthy
    and a slightly larger handful of the corporate and social elite.</p><p>How do you squash greed? It is the Goliath, and the majority of us feel helpless. Not only because the remaining hundreds of millions of us culminate into a singular David; the difference today is that Goliath is running through our veins, through our
    tainted faucet taps (look no further than Flint, Michigan), running into our gas tanks, our paper and wax beverage cups, trickling slowly into our bank accounts, through IV tubes at hospitals where the ill suffer from chronic diseases largely caused
    by our manufactured environment. The influence is everywhere, the challenge is channeling that power into something truly productive that aids in our collective advancement. Is it even possible?</p><p>-End of Entry-</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="66"><!-- react-empty: 67 --></div></section><section

Everything you stand for is the beacon and the solution we need at this critical hour.</p><p>You have had much to overcome: a frighteningly indifferent electorate misinformed by a corporate media juggernaut, manipulated ballots, a suspicious debate schedule limiting your voice to the people, the established, familiar faces of the Clintons and
    their well-oiled funding machine. I could go on but these are several factors which have made your campaign a difficult one.</p><p>As a young person today at the age of 24, saddled with student debt, watching a country founded on freedom and independence crumbling before my very eyes; watching the cesspool of rampant capitalism churn with its stark inequality, indifference to our
    environment and the struggles of the dwindling middle class... I've already had enough.</p><p>This is a pivotal moment in American history and the generational cycles that have recurred throughout it. We are amidst a crisis, Senator Sanders. You and Dr. Stein are the answer; we NEED a third choice. Between independent voters and the millions you
    inspired at your rallies alike, we are ready for sweeping changes to a dying system.</p><p>We have such potential in the world scope, yet that potential is repeatedly squandered by greed, promises of innovation suppressed and crushed by proven methods of profit. It can't continue, it isn't sustainable. I have your stump speech practically memorized.
    An endorsement of Secretary Clinton won't see your proposed changes come to pass.</p><p>Neither will internal party reform. The Democratic apple is rotting. We need a new framework, a new inspiration. I am ready for a revolution, yet your support and continued involvement with fiscally corrupted politicians and the lobbyists they are beholden
    to won't lead to a desirable outcome.</p><p>I know you are genuine in your convictions; please, while there is still time. Join Dr. Stein; neither Secretary Clinton nor (especially) Donald Trump will move us beyond the status quo. We don't want slow, incremental change. We want to join the rest
    of the industrialized world as an innovative, environmentally responsible, peaceful, democratic and celebrated union of peoples and new ideas for this emerging twenty-first century.</p><p>Sincerely, a concerned citizen,</p><p>Michael J Dentico</p><picture>
