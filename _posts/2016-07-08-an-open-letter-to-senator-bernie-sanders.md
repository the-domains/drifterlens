# An Open Letter to Senator Bernie Sanders

## July 8, 2016

Senator Sanders,

I wanted to take the time to write this brief letter to advocate what so many of your supporters already have: Please join Dr. Jill Stein and accept her invitation to run for president on this election's Green Party ticket.

Our political process, government and by extension, our nation is in shambles. Everything you stand for is the beacon and the solution we need at this critical hour.

You have had much to overcome: a frighteningly indifferent electorate misinformed by a corporate media juggernaut, manipulated ballots, a suspicious debate schedule limiting your voice to the people, the established, familiar faces of the Clintons and their well-oiled funding machine. I could go on but these are several factors which have made your campaign a difficult one.

As a young person today at the age of 24, saddled with student debt, watching a country founded on freedom and independence crumbling before my very eyes; watching the cesspool of rampant capitalism churn with its stark inequality, indifference to our environment and the struggles of the dwindling middle class... I've already had enough.

This is a pivotal moment in American history and the generational cycles that have recurred throughout it. We are amidst a crisis, Senator Sanders. You and Dr. Stein are the answer; we NEED a third choice. Between independent voters and the millions you inspired at your rallies alike, we are ready for sweeping changes to a dying system.

We have such potential in the world scope, yet that potential is repeatedly squandered by greed, promises of innovation suppressed and crushed by proven methods of profit. It can't continue, it isn't sustainable. I have your stump speech practically memorized. An endorsement of Secretary Clinton won't see your proposed changes come to pass.

Neither will internal party reform. The Democratic apple is rotting. We need a new framework, a new inspiration. I am ready for a revolution, yet your support and continued involvement with fiscally corrupted politicians and the lobbyists they are beholden to won't lead to a desirable outcome.

I know you are genuine in your convictions; please, while there is still time. Join Dr. Stein; neither Secretary Clinton nor (especially) Donald Trump will move us beyond the status quo. We don't want slow, incremental change. We want to join the rest of the industrialized world as an innovative, environmentally responsible, peaceful, democratic and celebrated union of peoples and new ideas for this emerging twenty-first century.

Sincerely, a concerned citizen,
