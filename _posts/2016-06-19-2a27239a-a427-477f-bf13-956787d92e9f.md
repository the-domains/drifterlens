# Still Hope
![Keep on.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3d4f7e44-d05a-45e0-b43e-143c6dc8521f.jpg)

There are no wrong answers.

The clock is ticking, but it shouldn't be limiting.

Keep your resolve, there's plenty of bitterness all around, keep it separate from your subjective experience.

Think of a small point, but ground it by relating it to physical matter. A grain of sand, an extremely tiny insect on a blade of grass.

Simultaneous, that which is smaller than you and incomprehensibly larger. The things that when thought about make you laugh without effort. The expanse of it all.

Which is why you realize that everything is transient. Pain, hope, sorrow, bliss, malaise. That very fact negates any attachment to the ephemeral.

Bear this in mind, know that you can grasp this moment and make the most of it, make the most of your talents, your passions, loves, the things that make your hairs stand on end and people close to you well up with tears of astonishment and inspiration.

Hope is never lost. There are thousands, millions of wrenches to be thrown into the engine, yet it keeps sputtering along, growing, improving.

This defines the great potential of humanity.
