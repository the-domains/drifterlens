It cleans by itself, so you don't have to.

Meet the Dyson 360 Eye, the first robotic vacuum offering from the British firm noted for its classy commercials and space-age industrial design. The initial release in Japan last October was the culmination of just over sixteen years of work; the product was met with palpable excitement.

Work on the project began in 1999, just eight years after the company's founding. James Dyson, the eponymous visionary, had already led his team to design a working, albeit underpowered prototype of the 360 Eye knows as the DC06 in 2001; he said regarding the matter at the time, "We've been developing a robot for years, and will produce a robot. And when we do, it will work. Properly."

The concept isn't new; iRobot's Roomba has been a household name for years. The biggest apparent differentiator is price. When the 360 Eye launched in the UK last month for £799.00 ($999 MSRP), jaws dropped. The question is, does Dyson's new product meet this valuation with features to match?

With its dome-shaped, live-vision 360° camera, Dyson's new machine captures a panoramic image of the room being cleaned; when coupled with the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) software chip, landmark-based navigation is achieved. The 360 Eye locks onto landmarks in the room to triangulate its position, ensuring a strategic cleaning pattern is devised and the unit knows which parts of the room it has already covered. Scheduling cleaning routines takes place via smartphone app.

It is also the only robotic vacuum with full tank tracks, which allows it to surmount household obstacles under 15mm in height. Similar to Roomba, the 360 Eye has drop detect sensors on its underside which prevent your thousand-dollar investment from taking a tumble down the stairs.

When it comes to its signature suction, the unit is equipped with the high-speed digital motor V2 which spins at a staggering 78,000 rpm, paired with Dyson's trademarked Radial Root Cyclone, which the firm claims to be its most compact cyclone technology yet. Advanced air filtration ensures that the air expelled by the unit is cleaner than what went in.

A full-size brush bar includes both coarse nylon bristles for ground-in dirt and soft anti-static carbon fiber filaments to remove fine dust from hard floor surfaces.

To understand how grueling Dyson's testing procedures are for a new product such as the 360 Eye, you need only look at the numbers. A team of 30 spent 100,000 hours in production. Prototypes underwent 297 validation tests, buttons on the device were pressed 16,500 times, and the testing units traversed a total of 671 miles.

The company also put its money where its mouth is, investing £5 million into robotics research and development.

Public response seems to match the care Dyson has put into this project. Megan Wollerton at CNET cites the powerful suction and good cleaning action; Jason Roberts at Vacuums Guide chose to focus on the advanced movement algorithms the device uses for thorough cleaning. Overall, the Internet has spoken positively toward Dyson's debut robotic offering. As the firm ramps up its North American marketing strategy for release by the end of the summer, only time will tell if the initial excitement progresses into continued satisfaction among users.
