Are we in the dog days of a broken system? A system with an elusive reward for empty labor, where your toil and time spent only reward you materialistically?

One can only hope.

For decades, the striving American has had to ritualistically abandon youthful idealism and dreams to the forces of the market. Without a well-timed stroke of luck, one's only option is to labor in a conformist system that dictates how you spend a great portion of your time.

This routine can rob us of our younger aspirations; the larger danger is that we unconsciously succumb to this routine, surrendering to a static pattern of life, unbroken by a mere 28.6% portion of each week considered "free time," where we can ruminate on the current state of affairs and try to muster the energy to perform more worthwhile pursuits. This, only to return to the same pattern come Monday.

What baffles me is that the outgoing active generation, the Boomers, largely made this surrender without incident, accepting it as "just what you do." How many talents went unnurtured, neglected to wither away on the sidelines of a blind and indifferent society?

Of course, there are exceptions. You can live on the fringe, where survival is closer to the forefront of your concerns in the name of passionate and fulfilling work. The obvious tradeoff is, to live well in this regard means to succeed into the same broken system you were rebelling against to begin with. What begins as a noble pursuit suddenly becomes the property of the market. The artist becomes the puppet at the hands of the moneyed marionette operator.

In short, this means surrendering your artistic or creative talents to the accountants and power brokers; create what will SELL, create what studies and focus groups have shown will be SUCCESSFUL. Forget artistic uniqueness or relevant message; homogeneous vanilla is a safer bet. With that said we can find relevance in today's media and art without a doubt, yet the compromises the artist has to make to exhibit a mere semblance of their original intent are palpable.

This is the true danger of the market; we find ourselves talking with intense and valid concerns about unfettered speculation and an unaccountable Wall Street, yet the real concern lies in the fact that a faceless economic entity determines what is produced, rather than natural human ingenuity and perception within the confines of that economy. This reality, unchecked, is turning us into a reactive and robotic populace. The burgeoning technology of today only augments this effect.

When we direct this schema towards the United States, it is at odds with the nature of our country. We prize the individual, yet we live in a time in which conformity dictates the will of the whole, groupthink taking center stage. A common literary debate involves questioning who was correct, Orwell with _1984_ or Huxley with _Brave New World_? Whose dystopia has come to fruition in modern times?

Both have. Simultaneously. 

So subtly, however, that it takes some peeling of the proverbial onion to appreciate the many-layered truth.

Large-scale dragnet surveillance revealed, perpetual warfare, bulging and unseemly defense budgets coming into question, whistleblowers like Edward Snowden opening our eyes to the grotesque wizard(s) behind the curtain. We are standing where Orwell would have given a cursory nod to this state of affairs.

Huxley on the other hand would be astonished by all of the modern distractions that have formed a warm, thick, pleasantly scented wool over our collective eyes. Heroin addictions in our suburbs, endless multimedia entertainment, fast-moving and unnecessary fashion and style trends, rampant consumerism, waste, easier travel, hedonism and hyper-sexualization, technology as a drug. Huxley would be astonished, yet his work would be validated before him if were here today.

More recent works of literature, such as M.T. Anderson's 2002 satirical novel _Feed_ serve as an extrapolation of existing trends; it is a piece written during the Information Revolution, portraying a fictional future America rife with constant connection, much like our existing smartphones and Internet. Yet in _Feed_, Anderson's characters are intimately merged with technology from birth; each newborn (conceived artificially by default due to ubiquitous sterility) is implanted with a neural microchip that irreversibly ties it to the marketplace and the collective consciousness.

Telepathic communication, whirlwind fads and hour by hour hairstyle changes, a deteriorating environment, an oblivious populace who are falling apart mentally and physically. This satire is a chilling yet plausible evolution of our current system if it persists, unabated by revolution or a collective awakening to the flaws of our ways.

Today's indifference should frighten you; how many conversations involving politics have you witnessed stopped in their tracks by someone who doesn't care? How many commercials have you seen advocating continued drilling for oil and natural gas, paid for by the same groups and lobbies that perpetuate the destruction of our environment?

The abstraction of profit and its uneven distribution has only caused our people and our planet immense strain. We view progress only in terms of continued monetary growth; what does this growth pursue? More growth. For the last half-century we have channeled initial postwar prosperity into nothing but additional economic expansion, not to the benefit of our own people or the domestic conditions of technology and innovation; mostly just to line the pockets (handsomely) of a handful of the ultra-wealthy and a slightly larger handful of the corporate and social elite.

How do you squash greed? It is the Goliath, and the majority of us feel helpless. Not only because the remaining hundreds of millions of us culminate into a singular David; the difference today is that Goliath is running through our veins, through our tainted faucet taps (look no further than Flint, Michigan), running into our gas tanks, our paper and wax beverage cups, trickling slowly into our bank accounts, through IV tubes at hospitals where the ill suffer from chronic diseases largely caused by our manufactured environment. The influence is everywhere, the challenge is channeling that power into something truly productive that aids in our collective advancement. Is it even possible?
