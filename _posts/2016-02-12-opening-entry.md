The creation of this site comes at a perilous and uncertain time in human history. There is much potential co-existing with great injustice and atrocity.

Many of the major issues of modern society rest on three integral pillars: ignorance, indifference and conformity. This site will serve to chisel and topple these pillars, apprising you of vital information, laying out the issues and their repercussions as well as why you should care.

Lastly this site strives to allow you to break free from how the herd at large operates; to promote powerful, productive and independent thought that has for so long been seemingly banished from the modern tableau of mainstream human life.

Welcome, enjoy the ride.

~Michael Dentico, founder
